public class Employee{
  private String employeeId;
  private String name;
  private string address; 
  private Date dateOfJoining;
  public boolean isPromotionDueThisYear(){
    //promotion logic implementation
  }
  public Double calcIncomeTaxForCurrentYear(){
    //income tax logic implementation
  }
  //Getters & Setters for all the private attributes
}
Since employee class has range of responsibility
Let us now refactor the Employee class to make it own a single responsibility.
public class HRPromotions{
  public boolean isPromotionDueThisYear(Employee emp){
    //promotion logic implementation using the employee information passed
  }
}
public class FinITCalculations{
  public Double calcIncomeTaxForCurrentYear(Employee emp){
    //income tax logic implementation using the employee information passed
  }
}
public class Employee{ 
  private String employeeId;
  private String name;
  private string address; 
  private Date dateOfJoining;
  //Getters & Setters for all the private attributes
}
